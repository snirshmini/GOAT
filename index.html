<h2><u>Club Career</u></h2>
<h4><u>FC Barcelona</u></h4>
<b><div>At age 13 Messi and his family relocated to Barcelona, and he began playing for FC Barcelona’s under-14 team.
 He scored 21 goals in 14 games for the junior team, and he quickly graduated through the higher-level
 teams until at age 16 he was given his informal debut with FC Barcelona in a friendly match.
 In the 2004–05 season Messi, then 17, became the youngest official player and goal scorer in the Spanish La Liga (the country’s highest division of football).
 Though only 5 feet 7 inches (1.7 metres) tall and weighing 148 pounds (67 kg), he was strong, well-balanced, and versatile on the field. Naturally left-footed, quick, and precise in control of the ball,
 Messi was a keen pass distributor and could readily thread his way through packed defenses.
 In 2005 he was granted Spanish citizenship, an honour greeted with mixed feelings by the fiercely Catalan supporters of Barcelona.
 The next year Messi and Barcelona won the Champions League (the European club championship) title.
 Messi helped Barcelona capture another treble during the 2014–15 season, leading the team with 43 goals scored over the course of the campaign, which resulted in his fifth world player of the year honour.
 He scored 41 goals across all competitions for Barcelona in 2015–16, and the club won the La Liga title and the Copa del Rey during that season.
 Messi topped that with 53 goals for Barcelona in 2016–17, leading the team to another Copa del Rey title. 
 In 2017–18 he scored 45 goals, and Barcelona won the La Liga–Copa del Rey double once again.
 Messi scored 51 goals across all domestic competitions in 2018–19 as Barcelona won another La Liga championship. In December 2019 he won his sixth career Ballon d’Or.
 In the 2020–21 season, Barcelona claimed the Copa del Rey title, the seventh of Messi’s career.Messi became a free agent in 2021,
 and financial issues-some of which were the result of La Liga rules-largely prevented him from re-signing with Barcelona.
 He left the club having set a number of records; notably, he was the leading goal scorer in the league’s history (474).
 Later in 2021 he signed with Paris St.-Germain.</b></div>

<h4><u>Paris Saint-Germain</u></h4>
<b><div>On 10 August, Messi joined French club Paris Saint-Germain.
 He signed a two-year deal until June 2023 with an option for an extra year.
 Messi chose 30 as his squad number, the same he wore as a teenager when he made his senior debut for Barcelona.
 Messi made his debut for the club on 29 August, coming on as a substitute in the second half of a 2–0 away win over Reims in Ligue 1.
 He made his first start and UEFA Champions League debut for the club in a 1–1 away draw against Club Brugge on 15 September.
 Four days later, Messi made his home debut for PSG in a 2–1 win over Lyon.
 On 28 September, Messi scored his first goal for the club, a strike from the edge of the 18-yard box after playing a one-two with Kylian Mbappé,
 in a 2–0 Champions League group stage win over Pep Guardiola's Manchester City.
 On 21 November, Messi scored his first Ligue 1 goal in a 3–1 home victory over Nantes.
 On 28 November, Messi provided a hat-trick of assists for the fifth time in his career as PSG beat Saint-Étienne 3–1 away from home.</b></div>
